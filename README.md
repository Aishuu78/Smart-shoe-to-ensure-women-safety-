# Smart-shoe-to-ensure-women-safety-
Developed an IoT-based wearable prototype using ESP32-C3 and GSM/GPS, which sends live location and automatically makes SOS calls in case of an emergency. The wearable would be a low-powered device and  would be tamperproof to make the wearable be tough in times of emergency. Accurate real-time alerts  for accurate positioning of a woman.
